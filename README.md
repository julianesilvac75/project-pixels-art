# Project Pixels Art - Trybe, Class 16-B

The goal of the project was to create a web page with a functional color palette for creating pixel drawings.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Technologies Used
- [x] Add the title "Color Palette" to the page.
- [x] Include a palette with four different colors.
- [x] Set *black* as the first color in the color palette.
- [x] Add a pixel board with 25 pixels.
- [x] Each pixel on the board should be 40 pixels wide, 40 pixels high, and bordered by a 1-pixel black border.
- [x] Set *black* as the initial color. When the page loads, black should already be selected for painting the pixels.
- [x] Clicking on one of the colors in the palette selects it and uses it to fill the pixels on the board.
- [x] Clicking on a pixel within the board after selecting a color in the palette fills the pixel with the selected color.
- [x] Create a button that, when clicked, clears the board by filling all its pixels with white.
- [x] Allow the user to define the size of the pixel board.
- [x] Limit the minimum size (5) and maximum size (50) of the board.
- [x] Randomly generate the colors in the palette when the page loads.

## Learnings

The project gave me the chance to create my first interactive web application. Manipulating DOM elements was quite challenging and added a higher level of difficulty, but it was very rewarding in the end. I plan to enhance the page with additional features, such as the option to erase only a painted pixel, add a warning about minimum/maximum size, create an option to generate new random colors, implement a dark mode option, and save user preferences. However, I'm already quite proud of the results so far.
